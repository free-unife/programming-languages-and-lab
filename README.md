# programming-languages-and-lab

Java files related to "Linguaggi di Programmazione 
e laboratorio" course in UNIFE (University of Ferrara), 
year 2013-2014, as well as material
personally studied and applied in 2016.

## Structure
 
This repository is divided in two parts:
- `class`: exercises done in/for class which are not very clear.
- `oop-training`: re-study of the course using different material.
  Much cleaner and organized.
